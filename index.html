        <p>Money that gives an annoying beep when touched with the multimeter. Coins has a disk-shaped, about 2 millimeters thin and has a radius of about 3 centimeters.</p>
        <p>Apparently the canadians have the nickname <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toonie">Toonie</a> for their 2 dollar coin. The inner side of the Toonie is gold/bronze-ish colored. The outerside does remind me of the stainless steel silver tint. </p>
        <p>The inner- and outer side are both conductive metals. The inner core is a aluminum/bronze mixture, the outer ring consist of 99 percent nickel. </p>
        <p>For me aesteticly the coin represents something valuable. This has most to do with the color/materials used in the coin. I wonder how the reactions are on if the Canadian gouvernment decides to bring a 5 dollar babyblue coin in the system </p>
